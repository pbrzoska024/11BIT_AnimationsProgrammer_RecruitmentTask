<!-- Goals -->
## Goals

The main goal is to create a new Animation Graph node - one that would mirror the input pose across the XZ plane.

● By mirroring we mean that any transform that would be applied to a bone on the left
side of the skeleton should be flipped and applied to a corresponding bone on the
right. An animation showing a character moving their right hand should show them
moving their left hand instead.
● The task should be done in C++. New subclasses FAnimNode_Base and
UAnimGraphNode_Base should be created. These should be used in an Animation
Blueprint to demonstrate how the mirroring works.
